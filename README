1.Introduction

sptalk is an XMPP server.

More detail about XMPP:

	http://www.xmpp.org/rfcs/

sptalk bases on spxml/spserver/spdict, and spserver bases on libevent.
More detail about these projects please refer their home pages:

	http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/

	http://code.google.com/p/spxml/
	http://code.google.com/p/spserver/
	http://code.google.com/p/spdict/

The sptalk code was developed under Linux, but has also been tested under
Solaris.

You can get the code from the sptalk home page:

2.Building

Before building sptalk, libevent must been installed.

You can donwload libevent from its home page:

	http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/

Edit spserver/Makefile to specify the path of libevent:

	LIBEVENT_INCL = -I<path_to_libevent_include>
	LIBEVENT_LIB  = -L<path_to_libevent_library> -levent

To build sptalk, type

$ cd sptalk
$ make

This will build the sptalkd program.

$ ./sptalkd -v
Usage: ./sptalkd [-p <port>] [-t <threads>] [-h <domain>]

$ ./sptalkd -h <domain>
[msg] This server is listening on port [5222].


Reports of successful use of sptalk are appreciated.

Enjoy!

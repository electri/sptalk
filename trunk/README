The sptalk code was developed under Linux, but has also been tested under
Solaris.

2.Building

Before building sptalk, libevent/spxml/spserver/spdict must been installed.
About detail revision of spxml/spserver/spdict, please see ChangLog.

You can get the code of spxml/spserver/spdict from their home pages.

Edit sptalk/Makefile to specify the path of libevent/spxml/spserver/spdict:

	SPXML_INCL = -I<path_to_spxml_include>
	SPXML_LIB  = -L<path_to_spxml_library> -lspxml

	SPSERVER_INCL = -I<path_to_spserver_include>
	SPSERVER_LIB  = -L<path_to_spserver_library> -lspserver

	LIBEVENT_LIB = -L<path_to_libevent> -levent

	SPDICT_INCL = -I<path_to_spdict_include>
	SPDICT_LIB  = -L<path_to_spdict_library> -lspdict

To build sptalk, type

$ cd sptalk
$ make

This will build the sptalkd program.

$ ./sptalkd -v
Usage: ./sptalkd [-p <port>] [-t <threads>] [-h <domain>]

$ ./sptalkd -h <domain>
